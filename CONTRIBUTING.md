# Contributing to Hackwork

Here are some rules you should follow if want to contribute to Hackwork.

## Reporting issues

Only accepted issues are bug reports and feature requests. Bugs are discrete
and reproducible problems fixable within the Hackwork code. Please read the
following guidelines before opening any issue.

* **Search for existing issues.** To be honest, it's painful to go through a
lot of duplicate issues. You help a lot by first checking if someone else
reported the same issue. Also, the issue may already be resolved.
* **Be sure that the bug is in the Hackwork core.** Sorry, I can't fix errors
with your web server. I can help, though.
* **Share as much information as possible.** Tell what operating system and
web server you're using, what customizations you did and other important
factors when useful. Include the steps with which you can reproduce the bug, if
possible.

## Pull requests

* **Don't pollute your pull request with unintended changes.** Don't rewrite
whole code in just one pull request.
* **Argument changes.**

## Standards

### Golden rule

> All code in any code base should look like a single person typed it, no
matter how many people contributed.

### Wrapping code

There isn't strict limit for length of code lines. 120 characters are most,
80 characters are perfect.

### Writing text

Always write sentences, including headings and code comments, in sentence case,
never in title case.

### Writing code

* 2 spaces (no tabs)
* No opening braces (`{`) on new line in functions and classes
* Space before opening braces (`{`) in functions and classes
* Omit closing tag in PHP only files
* Keywords in lower case
* Space before opening brace (`(`) in keyword functions, otherwise no
