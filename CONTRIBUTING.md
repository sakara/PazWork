# Contributing to Hackwork

Here are some rules you should follow when contribute to Hackwork.

## Issues

Only accepted issues are bug reports and feature requests. Bugs are discrete
and reproducible problems fixable within the Hackwork code. Please read the
following guidelines before opening any issue.

* **Search for existing issues.** It's painful to go through a lot of duplicate
issues. You help a lot by first checking if someone else reported the same
issue. Also, the issue may already be resolved.
* **Be sure that the bug is in the Hackwork core.** Sorry, I can't fix errors
with your web server. I can help, though.
* **Share as much information as possible.** Tell what operating system and
web server you're using, what customizations you did and steps to reproduce
the bug, if possible.

## Pull requests

* **Don't pollute pull request with unintended changes.** Don't rewrite whole
code in just one pull request.
* **Argument changes.**

## Standards

### Golden rule

> All code in any code base should look like a single person typed it, no
matter how many people contributed.

### Wrapping

There isn't a strict limit for length of lines. 120 characters are most, 80
characters are perfect.

### Quick style guide

* 2 spaces (no tabs)
* No opening braces (`{`) on new line in functions and classes
* Space before opening braces (`{`) in functions and classes
* Space before opening braces (`(`) in keyword functions, otherwise no
* Keywords in lower case
* Omit closing tag in PHP only files

### Letter case

Always write sentences, including headings and code comments, in sentence case,
never in title case.
